                    <br>
                    This image is a pair of socks I owned that I really love. 
                    The character printed on the socks is called Gudetama - 
                    a Japanese character published by Sanrio, which is the 
                    same company under which Hello Kitty was produced. <br>
                    <br>
                    The interesting aspect of this image is the extremely 
                    close zoom in. Without careful observation to see 
                    the fabric and texture, I believe it would be difficult 
                    to tell that this is a zoomed in picture of a pair of socks. <br>
                    <br>
                    Anyone who doesn’t know about Gudetama would also not be aware 
                    of the character. Although not obviously seen from this image, 
                    I really cherish this pair of socks because they were a gift 
                    from a friend who knows my obsession with Gudetama. <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s not so much the socks themselves, but the heart of that 
                    friend that remembered what I like and gave me these socks 
                    that really made this item significant to me.<br>
                    <br>

                    <br>

                    <figcaption> Jean Pagaduan, 2021</figcaption>
                    <br>
                    The image depicts a Venus flytrap planted in a bottle with water. 
                    The idea is very interesting because I’ve never seen this type of plant 
                    in water and in a closed container. <br>
                    <br>
                    My first question was: how does the plant trap insects while it’s inside 
                    that closed space? <br>
                    <br>
                    The next question I had was: why is it in the water instead of being potted?<br>
                    <br>
                    Regardless of my concern for the plant’s well-being to survive in water, 
                    I do see that it is doing well. I have no doubt that the owner is surely 
                    taking good care of the plant and knowingly putting the plant in this condition. <br>
                    <br>
                    I still find it pretty mysterious that the venus flytrap is being grown 
                    in the bottle.<br>

                  The article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and
                  Visual Thinking Skills” by Michael Gonchar outlines some examples of
                  how successful visual work can catch readers attention to and
                  interact with the readings more closely. <br>
                  <br>
                  <a href="https://www.nurturedigital.com">Nurture Visual</a> is a website in which I see this closely reading would happen.
                  Upon visiting the site, I soon stopped scrolling because an
                  interactive illustration on the left hand side caught my attention. <br>
                  <br>
                  I spend a couple minutes hovering around the different sections to
                  read and interpret the different visual elements the web designers include.
                  Without leaving where I initially entered on the site, I already have a pretty
                  good understanding of what the site would be about. This visual alone slows me down
                  because it sparks my interest to understand what each visual element means. <br>
                  <br>
                  As I (finally) start scrolling, I am encouraged to do so very slowly because
                  each panel has a different animation. The page automatically scrolls for me
                  after a certain time frame as well, so I was encouraged to just sit back, relax,
                  and enjoy reading the text. <br>
                  <br>
                  For these reasons, I would say that this website is one that I would agree to
                  have successfully accomplished the visual thinking goal Gonchar describes in his article. <br>

                    I read “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows” 
                    by Naema Baskanderi and learned many details that I would otherwise 
                    not pay attention to if I were to create a modal. <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    One of the most important points I heard is to 
                    not make the buttons on the modal confusing. <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Naema gave the example on how if a modal is meant for 
                    canceling an order, a “cancel” button on the modal can be 
                    confusing as the user wouldn’t know whether the button will 
                    actually cancel their order or cancel the process. <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    It’s funny to hear Naema point out these mistakes a web designer can make.<br>
                    <br> 
                    
                    I can recall how I, as a user, had also experienced something similar 
                    that frustrated me. <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    The article by Naema made me realize that there are 
                    so many things that could make a modal useful but also unhelpful. <br>

                <article id="article1" class="hidden">
                    I read the article “Best practices for form design” 
                    by Salim Ansari and learned many new things about 
                    what design pattern practices to make an application 
                    more user-friendly.<br>
                    <br>
                    The most important thing to note is that 
                    users can get lost fairly easily 
                    if the application is confusing or complicated to navigate.<br>
                    <br>
                    To keep users’ attention, Ansari gave many good practices on
                    how to minimize the work users have to do and provide as much
                    clarity in terms of what the users are expected to do. <br>
                    <br>
                    Doing so, usability, accessibility, and readability would improve 
                    and users are more likely to complete the form they are given! <br>
                    <br>
                    I personally love the typeform web form format.
                    An example can be found <a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/MvryfMWF">here</a>,
                    which is the Lovelace Hack sign up form. <br>
                    <br>
                    The form looks simple with step by step fields to fill in. 
                    It also lets user knows how many questions are left and 
                    keyboard shortcuts to make typing easier.<br>

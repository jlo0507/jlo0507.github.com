            <h2>Learning Journal 3</h2>
            <p>
                The article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and 
                Visual Thinking Skills” by Michael Gonchar outlines some examples of 
                how successful visual work can catch readers attention to and 
                interact with the readings more closely. <br>
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.nurturedigital.com">Nurture Visual</a> is a website in which I see this closely reading would happen. 
                Upon visiting the site, I soon stopped scrolling because an 
                interactive illustration on the left hand side caught my attention. <br>
                <br>
                I spend a couple minutes hovering around the different sections to 
                read and interpret the different visual elements the web designers include. 
                Without leaving where I initially entered on the site, I already have a pretty 
                good understanding of what the site would be about. This visual alone slows me down 
                because it sparks my interest to understand what each visual element means. <br>
                <br>
                As I (finally) start scrolling, I am encouraged to do so very slowly because 
                each panel has a different animation. The page automatically scrolls for me 
                after a certain time frame as well, so I was encouraged to just sit back, relax, 
                and enjoy reading the text. <br>
                <br>
                For these reasons, I would say that this website is one that I would agree to 
                have successfully accomplished the visual thinking goal Gonchar describes in his article. <br>

            <h2>Learning Journal 2</h2>
            <p>
                I read “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows” 
                by Naema Baskanderi and learned many details that I would otherwise 
                not pay attention to if I were to create a modal. <br>
                <br>
                
                One of the most important points I heard is to 
                not make the buttons on the modal confusing. <br>
                <br>
                
                Naema gave the example on how if a modal is meant for 
                canceling an order, a “cancel” button on the modal can be 
                confusing as the user wouldn’t know whether the button will 
                actually cancel their order or cancel the process. <br>
                <br>
                
                It’s funny to hear Naema point out these mistakes a web designer can make.<br>
                <br> 
                
                I can recall how I, as a user, had also experienced something similar 
                that frustrated me. <br>
                <br>
                
                The article by Naema made me realize that there are 
                so many things that could make a modal useful but also unhelpful. <br>
                <br>

        <article class="journals" id="journal_1">
            <h2>Learning Journal 1</h2>
            <p>
                I read the article “Best practices for form design” 
                by Salim Ansari and learned many new things about 
                what design pattern practices to make an application 
                more user-friendly.<br>
                <br>
                The most important thing to note is that 
                users can get lost fairly easily 
                if the application is confusing or complicated to navigate.<br>
                <br>
                To keep users’ attention, Ansari gave many good practices on
                how to minimize the work users have to do and provide as much
                clarity in terms of what the users are expected to do. <br>
                <br>
                Doing so, usability, accessibility, and readability would improve 
                and users are more likely to complete the form they are given! <br>
                <br>
                I personally love the typeform web form format.
                An example can be found <a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/MvryfMWF">here</a>,
                which is the Lovelace Hack sign up form. <br>
                <br>
                The form looks simple with step by step fields to fill in. 
                It also lets user knows how many questions are left and 
                keyboard shortcuts to make typing easier.<br>

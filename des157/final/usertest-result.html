    <h1>User Test Session & Results</h1>

        <h1 class="title"> User Observations: </h1>
        <h3> 1. Slideshow buttons are difficult to notice </h3>
        The biggest problem I noticed in all of my user testing sessions 
        was that all three users had trouble finding the buttons on 
        the slideshow. <br>
        <br>
        I received the feedback that because the users are simply 
        expecting to see images, they did not expect to search for buttons 
        to click on. <br>
        <br>
        One user did mention that they didn’t think the buttons were 
        extremely difficult to use - however, it would still be a good idea 
        to improve the design of the buttons for better user experience. <br>
        <br>
        The users agreed that the absolute positioning of the buttons over images 
        are understandable, but they suggested that I could add a glow, shadow, 
        or animation to the buttons to make the buttons more noticeable.<br>

        <h3>2. Viewport limitation</h3>
        Two of my user testers note that I set the viewport completely limited to 
        the 1366x768px. Although the assignment requirement is met, the limitation 
        is not so user friendly. <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, there’s noticeable blank space and the whole site was aligned 
        to the left. Initially, I designed the site completely limiting my view to 
        the class requirements. But my users' feedback is helpful in pointing out 
        my lack of user’s perspective viewing the site. <br>
        <br>
        I am also currently using screenshots of strict sizes of the images, 
        which make responsive interaction impossible. Although this is not a requirement 
        of the assignment, I agree with my users that this is an area I could improve 
        on to enhance user experience.<br>

        <h3>3. Form, Font, and Color Use</h3>
        My users in general agree that the overall design of the site is 
        simple and minimalist as I hoped it to be. However, one user noted that 
        the date and content on the left side of each image seem to have different 
        color and style from the text elsewhere. <br>
        <br>
        They believe the site would have a more uniform look and feel if these features 
        could be more consistent. They also had a hard time seeing that the numbers on 
        the left were the date of the image because the font weight difference was 
        hardly noticeable. <br>
        <br>
        Other than that, the users agree altogether that the color scheme matches 
        the theme of a diet art gallery and the slide color fits the rest of the 
        design as well. <br>
        <br>

        <h1 class="title">Update Plans</h1>
        First of all, I am planning to fix the problem all my users had on the buttons. 
        I am considering animating the buttons to change opacity when the user first 
        scrolls down. <br>
        <br>
        Because I aim to have a simple web design, I do not wish to make the buttons 
        more visible. I hope that image transformation will catch users’ attention more. <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, I am also going to ensure that the site has uniform form and font 
        as well as color use as mentioned by my users. If I have more time, I am going to 
        fix the viewport to be more user friendly without having to set limitation on 
        how users view the site. <br>

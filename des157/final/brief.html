        <h2> Project Summary: </h2>
        I plan to improve my Studio 2 Every Picture 
        Project because I wish I could have done a 
        better job showcasing my whole 30 diet journey. <br>
        <br>
        I plan to utilize pictures, videos, and audio 
        for the final’s revision as well as improving 
        the calendar view I attempted to go with by 
        adding more animation. <br>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1:</h2>

        I thought this website would be a good comparison 
        to my final project idea because of the gallery style.
        The user scrolls through a simple gallery of pictures 
        and when they interact with them, users are able to 
        see more details about the images. <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, the line animation smoothly done by this site 
        also works well in slowing down the scrolling action. 
        I also really like how subtle the buttons are displayed to 
        slide through the images in a presentation slide. <br>
        <br>
        What I would do to improve is to change the color scheme 
        and simplify the website even more. I would like to make 
        the website as easily readable as possible, retaining the 
        user attention and ensuring that most of their attention 
        would be focused on the images and the stories I’m sharing. <br>

        This website has many interesting web design ideas I observed. 
        Upon entering the site, the user sees multiple images and videos 
        that were quickly switched out in full screen mode. 
        This is exactly what I was attempting for during Studio 2. <br>
        <br>
        As the user scrolls down, this portfolio site demonstrates all 
        the projects that have been done. This is something I imagine 
        my website to have - as my users scroll through the pages, 
        the images or videos in the center will change while there’s a 
        background frame around the images that display the “calendar” view 
        and count down to show how far the user is going.<br>
        <br>
        The overall design is a good user experience as they’re walking through 
        a gallery of pictures with stories one by one with a tour guide. 
        By clicking on those images, users can also further explore the 
        stories behind these images if they find them interesting. 
        I would say that this website has the core idea of 
        what I want my website to look like!<br>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        My goal is to create a website with a minimalistic calendar look 
        that documents my whole 30 journey. The site would have a gallery view 
        of the “highlight” of what I had during this diet done in a 
        similar way like the two comparison projects. <br>
        <br>
        What makes the difference is that my site should have that emphasis 
        on the UI with the calendar overall interface that surrounds 
        the images and videos most of the time. I wish to achieve 
        this documentation of my diet in an interactive way in a 
        gallery/calendar view.<br>

    <section>
        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        My strategy is to make the site look simple and colorful - something 
        that might remind one with Google Calendar perhaps. I want the 
        user to enjoy the website’s look and have fun exploring the different 
        highlights I would put in different dates on the calendar.<br>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        The user should have plenty of interaction with the calendar 
        navigation bar with hovering, image enlarging, and scrolling effects. 
        I also plan to add sound feedback when users select or click on 
        certain dates or images to enhance the user's experience in interacting 
        with the site. <br>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        My goal is for my audience to enjoy the process of exploring 
        my personal experience with doing a whole 30 diet in a fun, engaging way. 
        I wish the user would walk away remembering not only about my stories, 
        but that they had spent enough time exploring the different functions 
        and buttons on the site. <br>
